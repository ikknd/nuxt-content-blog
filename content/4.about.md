A few words about me

#intro
Fullstack web developer based in Alicante, Spain. 

My background spans frontend and backend development, with a strong focus on Vue, Nuxt, and Laravel — particularly in the SaaS space. With over 14 years of experience building modern web applications, I specialize in combining clean architecture, elegant code, and thoughtful UI to create robust digital products.  

I thrive in collaborative environments, but I’m equally comfortable taking the lead on architecture, performance, or deployment. Outside of work, I’m always exploring new technologies, frameworks, and ideas — whether through side projects or deep dives into technical topics.
